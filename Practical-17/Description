17 WAP in C++ with the help of STL:
a. List:
1. Iterate a int list using iterator and print it
2. Find size of a list
3. Sort a list
4. Reverse a list


b. Vector:
1. Insert elements into a int vector
2. Iterate this vector using iterator and print it
3. Find size of a capacity and max size of a vector
4. Resize a vector
5. checks if the vector is empty or not


c. Map:
1. Insert elements into a <int, string> map
2. insert elements in random order
3. Iterate this map using iterator and print its keys and
values
4. Find an element as key from this map
5. assigning the elements from map1 to map2
6. remove all elements with key = x (any key present in
map)
7. Find size, max size of a map
8. checks if this map is empty or not
9. Clear a map


d. Algorithm:
1. Covert an Array into a Vector
2. Sort a Vector
3. Reverse a vector
4. Max element in a Vector
5. Min element in a Vector
6. Occurrences of x in a vector
7. Sort an Array
8. Binary Search in an Array
